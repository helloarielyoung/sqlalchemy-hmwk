1) Run python -i model.py again, and grab the employee object with the name ‘Cynthia Dueltgen.’ (Hint: later steps will be easier if you bind the result of this query to a variable name.)
    cynthia = Employee.query.filter_by(name = "Cynthia Dueltgen").one()


2) What department is she in? (Show the object for her department.)
    <see creation of "cynthia" object above>
    cynthia.dept_code


3) What is the phone number of the department that Cynthia is in?
    <see creation of "cynthia" object above>
    cynthia.dept.phone


4) Find all employees whose department we don’t know. (Hint: they will have NULL department codes.)
    no_dept = db.session.query(Employee, Department).outerjoin(Department).all()

    >>> for emp, dept in no_dept:
    ...     if dept is None:
    ...             print emp.name


5) Get a list of tuples with just the name of everyone whose favorite color is orange.
    orange = db.session.query(Employee.name).filter_by(fav_color = "orange")
    orange.all()


6) Find all employees who work in ‘Administration.
    admin = Department.query.get("admin")
    admin.emps
